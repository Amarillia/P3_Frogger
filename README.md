# Frogger (Clone)!

This is the source code for my take on the classic arcade game, Frogger (and you can play the game [here](http://amarillia.github.io/P3_Frogger/).  In the game you'll control a random character but you can change it with the key 'C' if you wish.

![Princess](images/char-princess-girl.png)

All along the way you're going to be avoiding these guys...

**...rampaging enemy bugs!**  

Each time you reach the **water** 10 points added to your score.

The game will end when you reach 100 scores and you haven't run ot from the 3 lives!  Try to improve your score on each try!

Press **F5** to resume play.  

And that's about it!  Use the **arrow keys** to move the hero and avoid from bugs to run over you.

I hope you enjoy the game!!
